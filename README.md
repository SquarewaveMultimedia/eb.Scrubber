# eb.Scrubber


This device allows you to control the playhead on any clip playing in the selected tracks, right from your Launchpad or Push.

The Device:

-Choose your Control Surface. 

-Re initialize the device if you unplugged your Control Surface, or didn't have it plugged in on Startup. 

-You select tracks with the 'Track' boxes. You can define the length that you want to have control over. . One to Four bars, or set it to dynamic to allways sync to loop braces. 

-Choose the length of the pattern recorder sequece in multiples of the sequence length. 

-Choose the color of each row. 

The Control Surface:

-If using a Push, hod the Select Button, then hit the User Button. If using an LP, hit the USER 2 Button. The pads do the triggering. You should see the playheads scrolling. If not, make sure you have the proper length selected in the device. 

-The Undo button will switch to golbal mode. On an LP, the UP arrow will switch to global mode.  

- The upper scene button will trigger pattern recording. It will flash red when recording and turn green when playing. You CAN overdub when it's playing. Another press will erase the sequence and get ready to record again. 

The lower scene button will put that track into stutter mode. As long as you hold down a pad, it will continue to trigger at the rate specified by the Clip Quantize parameter. 

On the LP you can change the clip Quantization setting with the other three arrow buttons.
